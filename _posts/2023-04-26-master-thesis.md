title: Reinforcement Learning with Visual Self-Modelling
---

This project starts by reproducing a recent work on robot self-modeling in a simulated
environment, where a robot learns a visual model of its own structure and
dynamics. It then extends this concept to a multi-robot setup. Although this expansion
introduces a heightened level of complexity, our investigation still highlights
promising patterns. The project also innovates by integrating the self-model into
a model-free reinforcement learning framework, adjusting the agent’s reward and
observation state based on the self-model. Our results showcase an improvement in
performance compared to conventional model-free reinforcement learning methods. [[pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/pdf/master-thesis.pdf %})]
