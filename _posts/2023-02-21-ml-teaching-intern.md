## Course Content Support
Assisted Prof. Edwards in teaching machine learning topics, including regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. The focus was on providing a thorough understanding of each algorithm's underlying mechanics and real-world applications.

## Tutorial Sessions
Held tutorial sessions that included both Jupyter notebook demonstrations and mathematical problem-solving exercises. These multi-faceted sessions allowed students to gain a hands-on understanding of machine learning algorithms' implementation, as well as delve into the mathematical theories that underpin these algorithms.

## Coursework: UK Premier League Dataset
For the coursework, a dataset from the UK Premier League was provided to students. The assignment focused on applying machine learning techniques to predict match outcomes. This real-world dataset allowed students to grapple with the complexities and unpredictabilities often encountered in data science projects, giving them a more holistic view of the subject matter.
